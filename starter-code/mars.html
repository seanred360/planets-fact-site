  Mars

  <!-- Overview Content Start -->

  Mars is the fourth planet from the Sun and the second-smallest planet 
  in the Solar System, being larger than only Mercury. In English, Mars 
  carries the name of the Roman god of war and is often referred to as 
  the "Red Planet".

  <!-- Internal Structure Content Start -->

  Like Earth, Mars has differentiated into a dense metallic core overlaid 
  by less dense materials. Scientists initially determined that the core 
  is at least partially liquid. Current models of its interior imply a 
  core consisting primarily of iron and nickel with about 16–17% sulfur.

  <!-- Surface Geology Content Start -->

  Mars is a terrestrial planet whose surface consists of minerals containing 
  silicon and oxygen, metals, and other elements that typically make up rock. 
  The surface is primarily composed of tholeiitic basalt, although parts are 
  more silica-rich than typical basalt.
