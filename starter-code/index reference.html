Mercury appears to have a solid silicate crust and mantle overlying a 
solid, iron sulfide outer core layer, a deeper liquid core layer, and 
a solid inner core. The planet's density is the second highest in the 
Solar System at 5.427 g/cm3 , only slightly less than Earth's density.

Mercury's surface is similar in appearance to that of the Moon, showing 
extensive mare-like plains and heavy cratering, indicating that it has 
been geologically inactive for billions of years. It is more heterogeneous 
than either Mars's or the Moonâ€™s.
