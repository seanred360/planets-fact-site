  Saturn

  <!-- Overview Content Start -->

  Saturn is the sixth planet from the Sun and the second-largest in the Solar 
  System, after Jupiter. It is a gas giant with an average radius of about 
  nine and a half times that of Earth. It only has one-eighth the average 
  density of Earth.

  <!-- Internal Structure Content Start -->

  Despite consisting mostly of hydrogen and helium, most of Saturn's mass 
  is not in the gas phase, because hydrogen becomes a non-ideal liquid 
  when the density is above 0.01 g/cm3, which is reached at a radius 
  containing 99.9% of Saturn's mass.

  The outer atmosphere of Saturn contains 96.3% molecular hydrogen and 3.25% 
  helium by volume. The planet's most famous feature is its prominent ring 
  system, which is composed mostly of ice particles with a smaller amount 
  of rocky debris and dust.
